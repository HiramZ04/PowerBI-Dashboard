# Business KPIs Tab

This tab centralizes the company’s most critical KPIs and SLAs, giving leadership a clear view of operational performance and areas of risk, by:
- Tracking warehouse volume SLA to ensure at least 33% utilization.
- Showing total orders and inbound shipments in the selected period.
- Measuring % of orders processed the same day when received before 11 AM, a key SLA for customer satisfaction.
- Displaying average order processing time to monitor efficiency.
- Highlighting inbound SLA compliance, including:
% of containers out of SLA for putaway and WMS received.
% of containers taking more than 2 hours to unload — directly tied to financial loss.
- Average time from dock to putaway and dock to WMS received.
- Allowing filtering by customer type and specific customer to focus on priority accounts.
- Serving as the primary SLA/KPI control panel for the company — enabling leaders to immediately spot issues and then drill down into detailed inbound or outbound tabs to find root causes.

This tab ensures SLA adherence, protects profitability, and enables fast decision-making when operational performance is at risk.
