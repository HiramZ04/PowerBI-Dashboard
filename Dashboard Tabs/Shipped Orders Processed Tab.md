# Shipped Orders Processed Tab

This tab provides full visibility into order processing performance, answering key operational questions such as:
- Average processing time for orders and SLA compliance tracking.
- Monthly and weekly order volumes, with breakdowns of packages, SKUs, and items per order.
- Customer type filtering (3PL vs. B2C) to analyze service patterns.
- Entry type insights (e.g., 321 classification) to measure compliance with the company’s primary business focus.
- Comparison of shipped orders vs. truck shipments over time.
- Percentage of total order volume shipped per weekday to provide insight into when the highest order processing occurs.

From a technical perspective, this dashboard overcame the challenge of merging two separate data sources—a manually downloaded WMS report and an incremental API feed. Initially, these existed in separate tabs, which caused confusion for leadership. By integrating them into a single unified dataset, we delivered a single source of truth for all shipped orders data, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and a streamlined user experience.
