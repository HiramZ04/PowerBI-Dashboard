# Pallet Usage Tab

This tab monitors warehouse storage usage, helping leaders make strategic space and cost decisions by:
- Showing the average pallet utilization percentage to measure how much of the warehouse capacity is in use.
- Tracking trends in pallet positions over time to identify if space usage is increasing or decreasing, and why.
- Identifying which customers and customer segments hold the most space in the warehouse.
- Prompting critical business questions such as: Is reduced space usage linked to lower sales? Do we need this much warehouse capacity if it’s underutilized?
- Supporting cost control by revealing underused capacity that could be reallocated or downsized.

By linking storage trends to sales performance and customer activity, this tab helps ensure warehouse space is optimized and aligned with actual business needs.
