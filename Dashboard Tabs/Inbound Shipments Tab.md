# Inbound Shipments Tab

This tab delivers comprehensive insights into all inbound processes, enabling warehouse leaders to monitor performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize resource allocation.

Key capabilities include:
- Tracking total inbound shipments and identifying manipulated shipments over time, with the ability to view trends by month or week.
- Forecasting high-volume days to allocate resources efficiently.
- Filtering by load type, customer, and other dimensions for targeted analysis.
- The Receiving Processing Time metrics are the most valuable feature—showing time from dock to WMS received, dock to putaway, unloading time, segregation time, and putaway time. This allows leaders to monitor operational efficiency and determine whether performance is improving or declining.
- A detailed table at the bottom provides transaction IDs, container numbers, metric times, arrival dates, and day names (excluding weekends to ensure meaningful business-day metrics). The table includes visual warnings:
- Red highlight for containers exceeding SLA thresholds for WMS receiving or putaway.
- Yellow highlight for containers taking more than two hours to unload—indicating direct financial loss due to operational delays.

By visualizing and tracking these metrics, warehouse leadership can quickly identify process slowdowns, determine staffing needs, and pinpoint where time and money are being lost. This SLA-focused approach is essential in the import/export environment, where maintaining workflow speed and quality directly impacts profitability.
