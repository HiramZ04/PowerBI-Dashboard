# API Bandwidth Consumption Tab

This tab tracks API bandwidth usage to control and reduce costs, providing insights that help avoid unnecessary tier upgrades and optimize system efficiency by:
- Showing total API calls and total GBs consumed over time.
- Identifying spikes in API calls or bandwidth usage to detect abnormal patterns.
- Highlighting which customers or integrations generate the most calls or bandwidth usage.
- Displaying % bandwidth usage per request type (Orders, Inventory, Other) to pinpoint the processes consuming the most bandwidth.

By understanding and managing bandwidth usage, this tab directly supports cost savings and more efficient API resource planning.
